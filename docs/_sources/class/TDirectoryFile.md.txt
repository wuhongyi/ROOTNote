# TDirectoryFile

v6.10.04

继承TDirectory

Describe directory structure in a ROOT file.

A ROOT file is structured in Directories (like a file system).  
Each Directory has a list of Keys (see TKeys) and a list of objects in memory. A Key is a small object that describes the type and location of a persistent object in a file. The persistent object may be a directory.


## class

```cpp
   // TDirectory status bits
   enum { kCloseDirectory = BIT(7) };

   TDirectoryFile();
   TDirectoryFile(const char *name, const char *title, Option_t *option="", TDirectory* motherDir = 0);
/// Create a new TDirectoryFile
///  A new directory with a name and a title is created in the current directory.
///  The directory header information is immediatly saved on the file
///  A new key is added in the parent directory.
///  When this constructor is called from a class directly derived
///  from TDirectoryFile, the third argument, classname, MUST be specified.
///  In this case, classname must be the name of the derived class.
///  Note that the directory name cannot contain slashes.

   virtual ~TDirectoryFile();
   virtual void        Append(TObject *obj, Bool_t replace = kFALSE);
/// Append object to this directory.
/// If replace is true:
///   remove any existing objects with the same same (if the name is not ""

           void        Add(TObject *obj, Bool_t replace = kFALSE) { Append(obj,replace); }
           Int_t       AppendKey(TKey *key);/// Insert key in the linked list of keys of this directory.
   virtual void        Browse(TBrowser *b);/// Browse the content of the directory.
           void        Build(TFile* motherFile = 0, TDirectory* motherDir = 0);/// Initialise directory to defaults.
   virtual TObject    *CloneObject(const TObject *obj, Bool_t autoadd = kTRUE);
/// Make a clone of an object using the Streamer facility.
/// If the object derives from TNamed, this function is called
/// by TNamed::Clone. TNamed::Clone uses the optional argument newname to set
/// a new name to the newly created object.
/// If autoadd is true and if the object class has a
/// DirectoryAutoAdd function, it will be called at the end of the
/// function with the parameter gDirectory.  This usually means that
/// the object will be appended to the current ROOT directory.

   virtual void        Close(Option_t *option="");/// Delete all objects from memory and directory structure itself.
   virtual void        Copy(TObject &) const { MayNotUse("Copy(TObject &)"); }
   virtual Bool_t      cd(const char *path = 0);
/// Change current directory to "this" directory.
/// Using path one can
/// change the current directory to "path". The absolute path syntax is:
///     file.root:/dir1/dir2
/// where file.root is the file and /dir1/dir2 the desired subdirectory
/// in the file. Relative syntax is relative to "this" directory. E.g:
/// ../aa. Returns kTRUE in case of success.

   virtual void        Delete(const char *namecycle="");
/// Delete Objects or/and keys in a directory
/// Properties of the namecycle string:
///   - namecycle has the format name;cycle
///   - namecycle = "" is same as namecycle ="T*"
///   - name  = * means all
///   - cycle = * means all cycles (memory and keys)
///   - cycle = "" or cycle = 9999 ==> apply to a memory object
/// When name=* use T* to delete subdirectories also
/// To delete one directory, you must specify the directory cycle,
/// eg.  file.Delete("dir1;1");
/// Examples:
/// | Pattern | Description |
/// |---------|-------------|
/// |   foo   | delete object named foo in memory |
/// |   foo*  | delete all objects with a name starting with foo |
/// |   foo;1 | delete cycle 1 of foo on file |
/// |   foo;* | delete all cycles of foo on file and also from memory |
/// |   *;2   | delete all objects on file having the cycle 2 |
/// |   *;*   | delete all objects from memory and file |
/// |   T*;*  | delete all objects from memory and file and all subdirectories |
/// ## WARNING
/// If the key to be deleted contains special characters ("+","^","?", etc
/// that have a special meaning for the regular expression parser (see TRegexp)
/// then you must specify 2 backslash characters to escape the regular expression.
/// For example, if the key to be deleted is namecycle = "C++", you must call
///     mydir.Delete("C\\+\\+"));

   virtual void        FillBuffer(char *&buffer);
/// Encode directory header into output buffer

   virtual TKey       *FindKey(const char *keyname) const;
/// Find key with name keyname in the current directory

   virtual TKey       *FindKeyAny(const char *keyname) const;
/// Find key with name keyname in the current directory or
/// its subdirectories.
/// NOTE: that If a key is found, the directory containing the key becomes
/// the current directory

   virtual TObject    *FindObjectAny(const char *name) const;
/// Find object by name in the list of memory objects of the current
/// directory or its sub-directories.
/// After this call the current directory is not changed.
/// To automatically set the current directory where the object is found,
/// use FindKeyAny(aname)->ReadObj().

   virtual TObject    *FindObjectAnyFile(const char *name) const;
/// Scan the memory lists of all files for an object with name

   virtual TObject    *Get(const char *namecycle);
/// Return pointer to object identified by namecycle.
/// Properties:
///   - namecycle has the format name;cycle
///   - name  = * is illegal, cycle = * is illegal
///   - cycle = "" or cycle = 9999 ==> apply to a memory object
/// Examples:
/// | Pattern | Explanation |
/// |---------|-------------|
/// |  foo    | get object named foo in memory if object is not in memory, try with highest cycle from file |
/// |  foo;1  | get cycle 1 of foo on file |
/// The retrieved object should in principle derive from TObject.
/// If not, the function TDirectoryFile::GetObject should be called.
/// However, this function will still work for a non-TObject, provided that
/// the calling application cast the return type to the correct type (which
/// is the actual type of the object).
/// ### The GetObjectMethod
/// The method GetObject offers better protection and avoids the need
/// for any cast:
/// ~~~{.cpp}
/// MyClass *obj;
/// directory->GetObject("some object",obj);
/// if (obj) { ... the object exist and inherits from MyClass ... }
/// ~~~
/// ### Very important note about inheritance
/// In case the class of this object derives from TObject but not
/// as a first inheritance, one must use dynamic_cast<>().
/// #### Example 1 - Normal case:
///     class MyClass : public TObject, public AnotherClass
/// then on return, one can adopt a C style cast:
///     auto objPtr = (MyClass*)directory->Get("some object of MyClass");
/// #### Example 2 - Special case:
///     class MyClass : public AnotherClass, public TObject
/// then on return, one must do:
///     auto objPtr = dynamic_cast<MyClass*>(directory->Get("some object of MyClass"));
/// Of course, dynamic_cast<> can also be used in the example 1.

   virtual TDirectory *GetDirectory(const char *apath, Bool_t printError = false, const char *funcname = "GetDirectory");
/// Find a directory named "apath".
/// It apath is null or empty, returns "this" directory.
/// Otherwise use the name "apath" to find a directory.
/// The absolute path syntax is:
///     file.root:/dir1/dir2
/// where file.root is the file and /dir1/dir2 the desired subdirectory
/// in the file. Relative syntax is relative to "this" directory. E.g:
/// ../aa.
/// Returns 0 in case path does not exist.
/// If printError is true, use Error with 'funcname' to issue an error message.

///   - cycle = "" or cycle = 9999 ==> apply to a memory object
