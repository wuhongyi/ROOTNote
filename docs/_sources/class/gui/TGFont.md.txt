# TGFont

TGFont and TGFontPool                                                
                                                                     
Encapsulate fonts used in the GUI system.                            
TGFontPool provides a pool of fonts.
TGTextLayout is used to keep track of string  measurement            
information when  using the text layout facilities.                  
It can be displayed with respect to any origin.
