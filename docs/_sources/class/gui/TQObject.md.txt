# TQObject

This is the ROOT implementation of the Qt object communication       
mechanism (see also http:www.troll.no/qt/metaobjects.html)         
                                                                     
Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.        
When an object has changed in some way that might be interesting     
for the outside world, it emits a signal to tell whoever is          
listening. All slots that are connected to this signal will be       
activated (called).  It is even possible to connect a signal         
directly to  another signal (this will emit the second signal        
immediately whenever the first is emitted.) There is no limitation   
on the number of slots that can be connected to a signal.            
The slots will be activated in the order they were connected         
to the signal. This mechanism allows objects to be easily reused,    
because the object that emits a signal does not need to know         
to what the signals are connected to.                                
Together, signals and slots make up a powerfull component            
programming mechanism.
