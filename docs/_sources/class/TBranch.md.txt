# TBranch

继承 TNamed , TAttFill

A TTree object is a list of TBranchs.  
A TBranch describes the branch data structure and supports :
 - the list of TBaskets (branch buffers) associated to this branch.
 - the list of TLeaves (branch description) 




## class

```cpp
   TBranch();
   TBranch(TTree *tree, const char *name, void *address, const char *leaflist, Int_t basketsize=32000, Int_t compress=-1);
/// Create a Branch as a child of a Tree
///       * address is the address of the first item of a structure
///         or the address of a pointer to an object (see example in TTree.cxx).
///       * leaflist is the concatenation of all the variable names and types
///         separated by a colon character :
///         The variable name and the variable type are separated by a
///         slash (/). The variable type must be 1 character. (Characters
///         after the first are legal and will be appended to the visible
///         name of the leaf, but have no effect.) If no type is given, the
///         type of the variable is assumed to be the same as the previous
///         variable. If the first variable does not have a type, it is
///         assumed of type F by default. The list of currently supported
///         types is given below:
///            - C : a character string terminated by the 0 character
///            - B : an 8 bit signed integer (Char_t)
///            - b : an 8 bit unsigned integer (UChar_t)
///            - S : a 16 bit signed integer (Short_t)
///            - s : a 16 bit unsigned integer (UShort_t)
///            - I : a 32 bit signed integer (Int_t)
///            - i : a 32 bit unsigned integer (UInt_t)
///            - F : a 32 bit floating point (Float_t)
///            - D : a 64 bit floating point (Double_t)
///            - L : a 64 bit signed integer (Long64_t)
///            - l : a 64 bit unsigned integer (ULong64_t)
///            - O : [the letter 'o', not a zero] a boolean (Bool_t)
///         Arrays of values are supported with the following syntax:
///         - If leaf name has the form var[nelem], where nelem is alphanumeric, then
///              if nelem is a leaf name, it is used as the variable size of the array,
///              otherwise return 0.
///              The leaf referred to by nelem **MUST** be an int (/I),
///         - If leaf name has the form var[nelem], where nelem is a non-negative integers, then
///              it is used as the fixed size of the array.
///         - If leaf name has the form of a multi dimension array (e.g. var[nelem][nelem2])
///              where nelem and nelem2 are non-negative integers) then
///              it is used as a 2 dimensional array of fixed size.
///         - Any of other form is not supported.
///    Note that the TTree will assume that all the item are contiguous in memory.
///    On some platform, this is not always true of the member of a struct or a class,
///    due to padding and alignment.  Sorting your data member in order of decreasing
///    sizeof usually leads to their being contiguous in memory.
///       * bufsize is the buffer size in bytes for this branch
///         The default value is 32000 bytes and should be ok for most cases.
///         You can specify a larger value (e.g. 256000) if your Tree is not split
///         and each entry is large (Megabytes)
///         A small value for bufsize is optimum if you intend to access
///         the entries in the Tree randomly and your Tree is in split mode.
///   Note that in case the data type is an object, this branch can contain
///   only this object.
///    Note that this function is invoked by TTree::Branch
