继承TDirectoryFile

A ROOT file is a suite of consecutive data records (TKey instances) with
a well defined format.

If the key is located past the 32 bit file limit (> 2 GB) then some fields will
be 8 instead of 4 bytes:

```
Byte Range      | Member Name | Description
----------------|-----------|--------------
1->4            | Nbytes    | Length of compressed object (in bytes)
5->6            | Version   | TKey version identifier
7->10           | ObjLen    | Length of uncompressed object
11->14          | Datime    | Date and time when object was written to file
15->16          | KeyLen    | Length of the key structure (in bytes)
17->18          | Cycle     | Cycle of key
19->22 [19->26] | SeekKey   | Pointer to record itself (consistency check)
23->26 [27->34] | SeekPdir  | Pointer to directory header
27->27 [35->35] | lname     | Number of bytes in the class name
28->.. [36->..] | ClassName | Object Class Name
..->..          | lname     | Number of bytes in the object name
..->..          | Name      | lName bytes with the name of the object
..->..          | lTitle    | Number of bytes in the object title
..->..          | Title     | Title of the object
----->          | DATA      | Data bytes associated to the object
```

The first data record starts at byte fBEGIN (currently set to kBEGIN).
Bytes 1->kBEGIN contain the file description, when fVersion >= 1000000
it is a large file (> 2 GB) and the offsets will be 8 bytes long and
fUnits will be set to 8:

```
Byte Range      | Record Name | Description
----------------|-------------|------------
1->4            | "root"      | Root file identifier
5->8            | fVersion    | File format version
9->12           | fBEGIN      | Pointer to first data record
13->16 [13->20] | fEND        | Pointer to first free word at the EOF
17->20 [21->28] | fSeekFree   | Pointer to FREE data record
21->24 [29->32] | fNbytesFree | Number of bytes in FREE data record
25->28 [33->36] | nfree       | Number of free data records
29->32 [37->40] | fNbytesName | Number of bytes in TNamed at creation time
33->33 [41->41] | fUnits      | Number of bytes for file pointers
34->37 [42->45] | fCompress   | Compression level and algorithm
38->41 [46->53] | fSeekInfo   | Pointer to TStreamerInfo record
42->45 [54->57] | fNbytesInfo | Number of bytes in TStreamerInfo record
46->63 [58->75] | fUUID       | Universal Unique ID
```

/// A ROOT file is designed such that one can write in the file in pure
/// sequential mode (case of BATCH jobs). In this case, the file may be
/// read sequentially again without using the file index written
/// at the end of the file. In case of a job crash, all the information
/// on the file is therefore protected.
/// A ROOT file can be used interactively. In this case, one has the
/// possibility to delete existing objects and add new ones.
/// When an object is deleted from the file, the freed space is added
/// into the FREE linked list (fFree). The FREE list consists of a chain
/// of consecutive free segments on the file. At the same time, the first
/// 4 bytes of the freed record on the file are overwritten by GAPSIZE
/// where GAPSIZE = -(Number of bytes occupied by the record).
/// Option compress is used to specify the compression level and algorithm:
///
///     compress = 100 * algorithm + level
///
/// Level | Explanation
/// ------|-------------
/// 0   | objects written to this file will not be compressed.
/// 1   | minimal compression level but fast.
/// ... | ....
/// 9   | maximal compression level but slower and might use more memory.
/// (For the currently supported algorithms, the maximum level is 9)
/// If compress is negative it indicates the compression level is not set yet.
/// The enumeration ROOT::ECompressionAlgorithm associates each
/// algorithm with a number. There is a utility function to help
/// to set the value of compress. For example,
///     ROOT::CompressionSettings(ROOT::kLZMA, 1)
/// will build an integer which will set the compression to use
/// the LZMA algorithm and compression level 1.  These are defined
/// in the header file <em>Compression.h</em>.
/// Note that the compression settings may be changed at any time.
/// The new compression settings will only apply to branches created
/// or attached after the setting is changed and other objects written
/// after the setting is changed.
