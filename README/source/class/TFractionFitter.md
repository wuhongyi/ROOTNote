# TFractionFitter

The virtue of this fit is that it takes into account both data and Monte Carlo
statistical uncertainties. The way in which this is done is through a standard
likelihood fit using Poisson statistics; however, the template (MC) predictions
are also varied within statistics, leading to additional contributions to the
overall likelihood. This leads to many more fit parameters (one per bin per
template), but the minimisation with respect to these additional parameters is
done analytically rather than introducing them as formal fit parameters. Some
special care needs to be taken in the case of bins with zero content. For more
details please see the original publication cited above.

```cpp
{
  TH1F *data;                              //data histogram
  TH1F *mc0;                               // first MC histogram

   Int_t status = fit->Fit();               // perform the fit
   std::cout << "fit status: " << status << std::endl;
   if (status == 0) {                       // check on fit status
     TH1F* result = (TH1F*) fit->GetPlot();
     data->Draw("Ep");
     result->Draw("same");
   }
}
```


```cpp
/*
## Assumptions
A few assumptions need to be made for the fit procedure to be carried out:
 1 The total number of events in each template is not too small
    (so that its Poisson uncertainty can be neglected).
 2 The number of events in each bin is much smaller than the total
    number of events in each template (so that multinomial
    uncertainties can be replaced with Poisson uncertainties).

Biased fit uncertainties may result if these conditions are not fulfilled
(see e.g. arXiv:0803.2711).

## Instantiation
A fit object is instantiated through
    TFractionFitter* fit = new TFractionFitter(data, mc);
A number of basic checks (intended to ensure that the template histograms
represent the same "kind" of distribution as the data one) are carried out.
The TVirtualFitter object is then addressed and all fit parameters (the
template fractions) declared (initially unbounded).

## Applying constraints
Fit parameters can be constrained through

 fit->Constrain(parameter #, lower bound, upper bound);

Setting lower bound = upper bound = 0 removes the constraint (a la Minuit);
however, a function

    fit->Unconstrain(parameter #)

is also provided to simplify this.

## Setting parameter values
The function

    TVirtualFitter* vFit = fit->GetFitter();

is provided for direct access to the TVirtualFitter object. This allows to
set and fix parameter values, and set step sizes directly.

## Restricting the fit range
The fit range can be restricted through

    fit->SetRangeX(first bin #, last bin #);
and freed using

    fit->ReleaseRangeX();
For 2D histograms the Y range can be similarly restricted using

    fit->SetRangeY(first bin #, last bin #);
    fit->ReleaseRangeY();
and for 3D histograms also

    fit->SetRangeZ(first bin #, last bin #);
    fit->ReleaseRangeZ();
It is also possible to exclude individual bins from the fit through

    fit->ExcludeBin(bin #);
where the given bin number is assumed to follow the TH1::GetBin() numbering.
Any bins excluded in this way can be included again using the corresponding

    fit->IncludeBin(bin #);

## Weights histograms
Weights histograms (for a motivation see the above publication) can be specified
for the individual MC sources through

    fit->SetWeight(parameter #, pointer to weights histogram);
and unset by specifying a null pointer.

## Obtaining fit results
The fit is carried out through

    Int_t status = fit->Fit();
where  status  is the code returned from the "MINIMIZE" command. For fits
that converged, parameter values and errors can be obtained through

    fit->GetResult(parameter #, value, error);
and the histogram corresponding to the total Monte Carlo prediction (which
is not the same as a simple weighted sum of the input Monte Carlo distributions)
can be obtained by

    TH1* result = fit->GetPlot();
## Using different histograms
It is possible to change the histogram being fitted through

    fit->SetData(TH1* data);
and to change the template histogram for a given parameter number through

    fit->SetMC(parameter #, TH1* MC);
This can speed up code in case of multiple data or template histograms;
however, it should be done with care as any settings are taken over from
the previous fit. In addition, neither the dimensionality nor the numbers of
bins of the histograms should change (in that case it is better to instantiate
a new TFractionFitter object).
