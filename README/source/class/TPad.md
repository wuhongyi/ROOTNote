# TPad

继承 TVirtualPad, TAttBBox2D

The most important graphics class in the ROOT system.

A Pad is contained in a Canvas.

A Pad may contain other pads (unlimited pad hierarchy).

A pad is a linked list of primitives of any type (graphics objects,
histograms, detectors, tracks, etc.).

Adding a new element into a pad is in general performed by the Draw
member function of the object classes.

It is important to realize that the pad is a linked list of references
to the original object.
For example, in case of a histogram, the histogram.Draw() operation
only stores a reference to the histogram object and not a graphical
representation of this histogram.
When the mouse is used to change (say the bin content), the bin content
of the original histogram is changed.

The convention used in ROOT is that a Draw operation only adds
a reference to the object. The effective drawing is performed
when the canvas receives a signal to be painted.


In ExecuteEvent, move, changes can be performed on the object.

For examples of DistancetoPrimitive and ExecuteEvent functions,
see classes
~~~ {.cpp}
      TLine::DistancetoPrimitive, TLine::ExecuteEvent
      TBox::DistancetoPrimitive,  TBox::ExecuteEvent
      TH1::DistancetoPrimitive,   TH1::ExecuteEvent
~~~
A Pad supports linear and log scales coordinate systems.
The transformation coefficients are explained in TPad::ResizePad.

TCanvas c1("c1");
h1.Draw();
c1.Print("c1.ps("); //write canvas and keep the ps file open
h2.Draw();
c1.Print("c1.ps"); canvas is added to "c1.ps"
h3.Draw();
c1.Print("c1.ps)"); canvas is added to "c1.ps" and ps file is closed


/// In the previous example replacing "ps" by "pdf" will create a multi-pages PDF file.

/// Note that the following sequence writes the canvas to "c1.ps" and closes the ps file.:

TCanvas c1("c1");
h1.Draw();
c1.Print("c1.ps");

///  The TCanvas::Print("file.ps(") mechanism is very useful, but it can be
///  a little inconvenient to have the action of opening/closing a file
///  being atomic with printing a page. Particularly if pages are being
///  generated in some loop one needs to detect the special cases of first
///  and last page and then munge the argument to Print() accordingly.
///
///  The "[" and "]" can be used instead of "(" and ")".

c1.Print("file.ps[");   // No actual print, just open file.ps
for (int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
  // fill canvas for context i
  // ...

  c1.Print("file.ps");  // actually print canvas to file
}// end loop
c1.Print("file.ps]");   // No actual print, just close.


/// As before, the same macro is valid for PDF files.
///
/// It is possible to print a canvas into an animated GIF file by specifying the
/// file name as "myfile.gif+" or "myfile.gif+NN", where NN*10ms is delay
/// between the subimages' display. If NN is omitted the delay between
/// subimages is zero. Each picture is added in the animation thanks to a loop
/// similar to the following one:

for (int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
  // fill canvas for context i
  // ...
  c1.Print("file.gif+5");  // print canvas to GIF file with 50ms delays
 }// end loop

/// The delay between each frame must be specified in each Print() statement.
/// If the file "myfile.gif" already exists, the new frame are appended at
/// the end of the file. To avoid this, delete it first with gSystem->Unlink(myfile.gif);
/// If you want the gif file to repeat or loop forever, check TASImage::WriteImage documentation
```
